\begin{abstract}
    People have long been searching, everywhere except in a high school maths textbook, for the sum of the first $n$ square numbers. Today, we present a closed formula for this sum.
\end{abstract}

Today, I am going to present the following theorem for all natural numbers $n$:

\[
    \sum^n_{k=1}k^2=\frac{n}{6}(2n+1)(n+1)
\]

The proof is left as an exercise for a reader.
